# APIAssignment

According to the assignment requirements, this repository contains ER diagram according to
requirements shared and has two folders StoreAPI and APIUsers.
StoreAPI has the API generated on OpenAPI specification according to the requirements
shared. Similarly, APIUsers is also on OpenAPI specification.
I am a newbie to web development but having interest in programming and learning new
technologies. I tried writing functions for StoreAPI but got stuck and require some guidance.
Therefore, I tried writing another API, APIUsers, which has only get option to fetch
people/employee details based on ID or full list.
In the span of a week, I learnt a lot related to web development but require some guidance
to fully grasp the subject. Internet resources helped a lot but some portions are not
mentioned clearly, where I require support. As, I haven’t learnt web dev formally so, I feel, I
got stuck but I learnt a lot while doing the assignment and I’ll try to get full command on
this as soon as possible.
